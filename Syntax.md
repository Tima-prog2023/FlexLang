# Description of FlexLang syntax:

The FlexLang language has a lightweight but functional and intuitive syntax. 
At the time of FlexLang 1.0, the language only has the function of outputting text to the console. This is done using the command "print.str". Here is the simplest program “Hello, World!”:
```python
print.str("Hello, World!");
```
